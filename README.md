# Capstone-Project


Our project's primary aim is to predict whether the customer is going to purchase something or not In this data set we have performed classification techniques and predict the intention of the Online Customers Purchasing Intention. The data set was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.
